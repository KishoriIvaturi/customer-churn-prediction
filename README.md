**Company Introduction**

- our client for this project is the HR Department at a software company.

- They want to try a new initiative to retain employees.
- The idea is to use data to predict whether an employee is likely to leave.
- Once these employees are identified, HR can be more proactive in reaching out to them before it's too late.
- They only want to deal with the data that is related to permanent employees.

**Current Scenario**

- Once an employee leaves, he or she is taken an interview with the name “exit interview” and shares reasons for leaving. - - The HR Department then tries and learns insights from the interview and makes changes accordingly.

- This suffers from the following problems:

- This approach is that it's too haphazard. The quality of insight gained from an interview depends heavily on the skill of the interviewer.
- The second problem is these insights can't be aggregated and interlaced across all employees who have left.
- The third is that it is too late by the time the proposed policy changes take effect.
- They want to supplement their exit interviews with a more proactive approach.

# **2. Problem Statement**
---

- Fetch the Data onto your Python Notebook and ponder upon the challenges present in the Data.
- *Our Role**
- we are given datasets of past employees and their status (still employed or already left).
- our task is to build a classification model using the datasets.
- Because there was no machine learning model for this problem in the company, we don’t have quantifiable win condition.   - we need to build the best possible model.
